   <h2> What is <b>About-Pqnos</b> website?</h2>
    <p>About-Pqnos website is the first website that I started building with HTML/CSS, and I hope to make it nice and beautiful.

   <div id="Questionanswer">
<h2>Why was this website built?</h2>
  <p>The main reasons I built this website were to exercise my skills in HTML/CSS, and this was my first big project,
     so I learned a lot of things while building it, and it motivated me to build other projects too!    
     Also, I know a lot of developers who have such websites, so I said Why not? 
    I have nothing better to do(I have).
  </p>

   <div id="Questionanswer">
<h2>What are the goals of this Website?</h2>
  <p>
    The goals of the website are to update it weekly with my progress and what I am working on so I can have motivation when working on projects.
