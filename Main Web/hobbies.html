          • Coding
        </h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.36em;"> Coding was something I started 2 years ago, It was
         a normal day at highschool and we had IT class, He taught us how to make websites with HTML and
         I really liked the idea of it so I spend hours on learning HTML and CSS and this is the result of it
         I have also learned a bit of python and C(and checked a bit of everythibg), I am currently learning coding with my own pace since I don't have a lot of free
         time, my favorite thing is creating webiistes here I can showcase what I have done and what I am currently learning:

          • Chess
        </h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.36em;"> Chess was something that I learned when I was like 10, although I didn't spent learning so much
          my elo when I started was around 300, I joined a small school tournament and I wonn my first match and then lost my second it was fun, after around 3 years
          I thought chess is cool I should learn a bit more after like a couple of weeks I reached like 500 elo and then gave up on it, I played with friends once in a whike
          So like in middle of the summer I though chess was cool and now I am more mature I should play more so in a span of 1 month I went to 800 elo and learned that my father's 
          peak elo was 1600, so I a 1600 FIDE rated player teach me a little bit more about it and now I am still learning!
<br>
<p style="font-size: 1.96em;"> Learning:
  <ul style="list-style: none;">
  <li>Basic Queen's Gambit opening ✅</li>
   <li>basic Carro-kun 78%</li>
  <li>Calculation 34% </li>
  </ul>
